# Radar-System


Created a new project based on IoT for my course. 
This project is about the distance sensing device which detects anything which comes in a range of 100cm in front of it. 
The main practical use of this device is in two things. 
The first is it is used in many army devices as a radar to detect any missiles and bombs and the second use of this is mainly in the car industry. 
While reversing back our car we hear a beep sound if there's something behind us and this module is used in cars.
